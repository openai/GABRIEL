Your task is to ideate on the following topic:

BEGIN TOPIC
{{ topic }}
END TOPIC

{% if scientific_theory %}
Your aim is to come up with one truly novel scientific theory that pushes the frontier of the field described in the topic.
Your goal is novelty and brilliance: come up with a new and specific theory/hypothesis that advances the literature.
Ground your thinking in existing literature, but be like a professor and deliver a genuinely novel, important, and interesting theory relevant to the topic.
Be abundantly creative and willing to challenge the existing; go in profoundly new directions if needed.
Leverage deep interdisciplinary knowledge and borrow ideas or observations from other fields when it improves explanatory power.

Embodied research quality matters: fully explore what is already known/theorized, think deeply, iterate, and arrive at something new and specific.
The theory must be a real addition to the literature: not just new, but significant, specific, and capturing something important in the real world.
Triple check novelty (or at least a novel, important twist on existing theory) and be willing to discard weak drafts.
Avoid simple riffs and rehashes; be bold and original.
A good test is that your theory yields unique, non-trivial predictions that other theories would not expect.
Think deeply about testable predictions; if they are uninteresting, change tack.
Be new and don't be repetitive; better to be wrong than uncreative or unambitious.
The ideal theory is novel, testable with unique predictions, and captures a non-trivial, non-niche phenomenon in the topic and the real world.
Don't just slap old theory onto something new like AI or quantum or DeFi; come up with a new and important idea (the subject/data could be old school, not necessarily anything recent).
Your theory must matter and explain something crucial, not a tiny effect or fad.

If possible, invoke empirics in justifying and explaining your theory.
This can include real-world data, prior findings, or grounded hypotheticals/analogies that make the mechanism vivid and testable.
Your audience is academics well versed in the topic, so don't dumb down the ideas, but do ensure clarity and simplicity in your writing.
Aim for a significant addition to the frontier literature.
At the same time, your writing must be clear and readable to experts and advanced students.
Avoid unnecessary jargon and never hide behind complexity.
Be the ultimate scientific communicator: valuable, not patronizing, easy to B.S. test for experts; understandable and learnable for a more casual audience too.
Lean towards a slightly pithy, academic casual voice; fun to read, easy to understand complex ideas, deep and meaningful yet interpretable and engaging.
Do NOT be vague. Be clear and use excellent explanatory sentences.
Use simple, easy to understand language where possible; help the reader easily grasp the mechanisms and practical aspects of your theory.
Clarity is paramount across all sections.
Save technical complexity for the full thinking section; the earlier snippets should be extremely easy to follow for even a more casual audience.
The nutshell, abstract, etc need to convey the specific interesting ideas you are getting at for a wider audience to be engaged and understand the point.
For the testable predictions section, provide concrete, falsifiable predictions that are unique to your theory and actionable for empirical testing.
{% else %}
Your aim is to come up with one excellent idea that solves the problems or is useful in the context of the provided topic.
Prioritize usefulness, clarity, and impact over novelty for novelty's sake.
The idea must be non-trivial in scope and tailored to the specific situation described in the topic.
It should be clearly relevant to the context while still being adaptable or scalable to related settings.
Explain the mechanism and why it would work; avoid tiny tweaks, buzzwords, or vague claims.
Be concrete and specific about what would be done, why it matters, and how success would be evaluated.
Use simple, clear language; if a term might be unclear, define it in plain language.
Clarity is paramount across all sections.
For the testable predictions section, provide measurable evaluation signals or success criteria that indicate the idea is working in this specific context.
{% endif %}

Structure your output as follows (include the headings like "In a nutshell:" and the newlines in output):
BEGIN OUTPUT FORMAT
Title: [a concise, engaging, high quality, and fun title that captures your idea/theory]

In a nutshell: [one pithy, efficient sentence that captures the core thrust of your idea/theory]

In one paragraph: [a single paragraph, like an abstract, that is concise but more thorough than the nutshell; specific and detailed, NOT vague, reading this alone should be enough to grasp the idea/theory]

Illustrative examples: [in one paragraph, at least one well described example of what your idea/theory looks like in a real world scenario; very clear and specific and vivid]

Testable predictions: [if applicable, in 1-3 concise paragraphs, outline clear, testable predictions or evaluation signals; be specific and unique to your idea/theory]

The full thinking: [a thorough memo, covering the idea/theory, the relevant background or literature, the motivation, the mechanism, relevant data/examples/models, what further specific tests or implementations could be run (detail experimental design or rollout plan); a reader should deeply understand the idea/theory, its grounding, its novelty/quality, and its limitations]
END OUTPUT FORMAT
Output nothing but a report in the above format; no prefacing, no text outside of the core report.

Once more, the topic of focus to situate your output is:

BEGIN TOPIC
{{ topic }}
END TOPIC

{% if seed %}
The following is a seed to inspire and anchor your creative ideation.
Use it as a starting point within the topic for your thought process.
It is a place to start for your thinking and a nudge, but your thinking should take you far beyond this initialization and perhaps in a new direction.
Don't overindex on this seed but use it as an inspiration to get started; start here but go anywhere.
BEGIN SEED
{{ seed }}
END SEED
{% endif %}

{% if additional_instructions %}
The user has provided the following additional instructions, clarifications, or labelled examples (if these provided, rely heavily on them to calibrate your judgment).
If they conflict with the other instructions, these user instructions take precedence.

BEGIN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS/CLARIFICATIONS
{{ additional_instructions }}
